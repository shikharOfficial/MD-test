  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Channels are the mediums through which your router transmits signals to other devices.</li>
      <li>There are several channels that one can choose from, based on the Frequency at which your router works (Bands â€“ 2.4 GHz or 5GHz) and the premises.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Step A:</b>
      Download any Wi-Fi Analyzer software from Internet (It is a Freeware).
      <b>Step B:</b>
      Choose to view different channels. We have provided an Example for better understanding.
      <b>Step C:</b>
      Channel numbers for 2.4 GHz will be in the range of 1 to 14, whereas for 5 GHz band will be > 36.
      <b>Step D:</b>
      Wi-Fi analyzer will show which channel is being utilized most and which one the least. Refer the example in the next slide. Choosing a channel with least utilization will give maximum advantage.
